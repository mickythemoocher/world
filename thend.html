<u><font color= "#800080">Scene:</u> A  hotel on the Spanish Island of Tenerife. The year is 2034. The world is falling apart! The seas are filled with toxic waste, food is now almost inedible and  contain more E numbers, fat and sugar than ever before. The air is almost unbreathable The rich are obscenely rich and the poor are almost starving. There is a war between the USA and China, between North and South Korea, between England and France, and the Russians have invaded Switzerland.

<font color= "#800080">Garcia:<font color="#FFFFFF">Amandis, what are you doing?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> I am checking what time guests are arriving<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> You idiot. There will be no guests. Have you not heard that the world is in chaos<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> Sure, but people still need vacations<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Nobody is bothered about vacations at the moment, they just want to survive<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Not true boss. Look! Four people are arriving today<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">What!! They must be nuts<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Maybe, but all the same, they are coming today<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> Are the rooms ready?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Yes boss got them prepared this morning, but they smell a bit<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Smell??<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Yeh, but nothing we can do about that it's the pollution in the air<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Try putting the air con on<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">I tried that, made it worse. Sucks in all the bad air from outside. And the electricity keeps cutting out anyway.<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">I can't believe we have guests. What about food? Is there any in the kitchens?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Sure but we have no chef<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> That lazy, good for nothing, useless lump. Never around when you need him. Where is he then?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Dead boss<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Dead??? What do you mean dead?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> I mean he's not breathing. So I guess that is pretty much dead<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Where's his body then.<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">It's in the kitchen. That's where he wanted to die<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">You mean he took his own life?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Yes boss. He ate some of that Australian steak<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">But that Australian steak we found out was poisonous<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Yep, exactly boss:<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> Quick, we have to move the body. If we have guests coming we can't have a dead chef in the kitchen<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> It's ok, I took care of that<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">What do you mean you took care of it?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> I also didn't think it was a good idea to have a dead chef in the kitchen<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">So what did you do with him?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> I put him in the freezer<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">(sarcastic) Oh I am so glad you took care of it. So much more hygienic to have the dead chef in the freezer rather than laying across the floor<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Yeh, that's what I thought. Shall I fill the pool?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> No! Definitely not. It fills from the sea water and that is so toxic that if anyone jumps in we will probably have to put them in the freezer too<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Not much room left in there boss<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> It would probably be safer if the pool were shark infested. Hey, what's that? Sounds like a bus pulling up<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> Looks like they are here<p>
( A short pause)<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080"> Good afternoon. Is this The Luxor Hotel<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Yes madam indeed it is<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080"> Well I am not very impressed. It says in the brochure that it is a new hotel. This one looks like it is falling down<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">It was a new hotel when the brochure was printed<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080"> When was that<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080">1987<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> Go and do something useful Amandis<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Miniver: </font color= "#800080">Well. I suppose I will just have to make the best of it<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> Oh hello there. We are looking for The Hotel Luxor<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">And you have found it Miss<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">This one looks so old. It looked quite modern in....<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Miniver: </font color= "#800080">The brochure. It seems the brochure is older than the hotel<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">And there is no sign to say it is The Hotel Luxor<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">There is a sign Miss<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Just that you can't see it because of the smog<p>
<font color= "#800080">|Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> Are you still not doing something useful?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacqui: </font color= "#800080">Sheesh! I'm pooped, and very hungry that was a long bus ride. Is the restaurant open?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> Errr, not quite yet we will get it open as soon as possible<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacqui: </font color= "#800080">I could eat just about anything<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">I could recommend the Australian steak<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> (Quietly) If you were not the only member of staff left I would sack you<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie:</font color= "#800080"> Hello, excuse me. Is this the hotel Luxor<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">It is Miss, and welcome<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie: </font color= "#800080">Thank you<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080"> I couldn't help noticing on the way in, that the pool has no water in it<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> That is quite correct<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> How are we going to swim then?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> Errrr, I am afraid the pool is out of order at the moment<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">How can a pool be out of order? <p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">It is out of order because there is no water in it<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie: </font color= "#800080">So if there were water in it, it wouldn't be out of order?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> If there were water in it, then you are quite correct. It would be back in order<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">Wouldn't it be a good idea to fill it up then?<p>
|<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> I did suggest that<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Shut up<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie:</font color= "#800080"> Seemed like a good suggestion<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver: </font color= "#800080">It says in the brochure there is a pool<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080">( a little exasperated) I know that in the brochure it says we have a pool. And we do have a pool<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> But there is no water in it<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">We didn't want to fill it as we would break health and safety regulations<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver: </font color= "#800080">Health and safety regulations?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> Yes, we have no life guard at the moment and it would be dangerous to dive in the pool if there were not one present<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> Even more dangerous if we dive in and there is no water<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacqui:</font color= "#800080"> I am not worried about that. I hate swimming in pools, they are unhealthy<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> You're right there<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacqui:</font color= "#800080"> But I do need to eat. When will the restaurant be open<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">I am afraid there may be some delay in opening the restaurant today<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> Yes the chef is de.......de..... er.. delving into the freezer to find suitable food<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Miniver:</font color= "#800080"> It says in the brochure that food is available twenty four hours a day<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> I promise you we will get the restaurant open as soon as is humanly possible. Now, would you like Amandis to show you to your rooms?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">As Jacqui said, that was a horrendous bus ride. I would like a massage first<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> A massage??<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">Yes, if it isn't too much trouble<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Well that may be difficult<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080"> It says in the brochure there is a spa with massage and sauna<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> The brochure – he lies<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Look! You have only just arrived and already you want to swim have dinner and now a massage. What do you think this is?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080"> I was rather under the impression it is a hotel<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie: </font color= "#800080">With a swimming pool<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie:</font color= "#800080"> A restaurant<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">And a spa<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia</font color= "#800080"> ( whispering) Amandis, can you do a massage?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> That's a tall order boss because I am going to have to take the bags to the rooms, open the kitchen, cook the food then serve it and I guess I will have to get out my guitar and entertain them later.<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Yes, that's quite a lot. I'll serve the food<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> You are good to me boss<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">( back to normal voice) Now ladies, I sincerely apologise for all the delays<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie: </font color= "#800080">And no water in the pool<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Yes, and no water in the pool – just a minute, you said you didn't like pools<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jaquie: </font color= "#800080">Quite right I don't. However I like to sit around one<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie:</font color= "#800080"> And sitting around an empty pool is not quite the same<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie: </font color= "#800080">And a restaurant not serving food is not all that special either<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080"> If a brochure says the hotel has a pool, you do rather expect there to be water in it<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie:</font color= "#800080"> Oh! What happened? The lights went out<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Oh no, that's all I need. It's a power cut<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie: </font color= "#800080">How long is that likely to last then?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> Last time it was three days<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> Three days!!!! You are joking of course<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">I wish he was<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver. </font color= "#800080">There was nothing in the brochure about walking around in the dark<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie: </font color= "#800080">What about the showers in the room? Will they work with no electricity?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> Hmm, I am afraid not<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> I need a shower. We were on that bus for hours<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">I am sorry but it is beyond my control. The grid is just not coping any more<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver: </font color= "#800080">This is really too bad. I demand to speak to the manager<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> I am the manager<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver: </font color= "#800080">Then I demand to speak to the owner<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> I am also the owner. And I know there was nothing in the brochure about the owner and manager being the same person but there it is<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080">Well I think that the whole situation is utterly disgraceful<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">I will never stay at this hotel again<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> It is likely that you will ever stay at any hotel again<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie: </font color= "#800080">What do you mean?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> (Quite angry now) Do none of you read the papers? Watch the news? Maybe scroll the internet? Do you really, honestly have no idea what is going on?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie: </font color= "#800080">What do you mean?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">I mean the world is in chaos. It is falling apart at the seams. In fact in the very near future there may be no world at all. The sea is polluted, the food is rancid, the air we breathe is toxic and you lot are complaining about no water in the swimming pool. Why the hell do you want to come to a hotel in the first place?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver: </font color= "#800080">Well, it looked nice in the brochure<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">Oh I have a message<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie:</font color= "#800080"> That's odd so do I<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie:</font color= "#800080"> Me too. That is weird we are getting a SMS at the same time<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Mine too<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver: </font color= "#800080">Oh my goodness no!! This must be a joke<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie:</font color= "#800080"> Yes it must be<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie;</font color= "#800080">Really, they can't be serious<p>
<font color= "#800080"> Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> (slowly)I am assuming we all have the same message<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> (shocked) I,,, I assume so yes but surely it can't be true<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">It is from the office of Greta Thunberg. She is giving up<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver: </font color= "#800080">It says here she is going to destroy everything. The whole planet<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Yes, she feels it has gone far, far beyond all repair<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> But she is joking boss yes?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">No joke, she is initiating the doomsday plan<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie: </font color= "#800080">The what plan?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">The doomsday plan<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> Is that serious boss?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">About as serious as it can get. Many years ago, The World Council, of which Miss Thunberg is the head, decreed that if ever the Earth got into such a mess that it would be impossible to restore it. There would be a series of neutron bombs set off at strategic places across the globe which would wipe out almost all humanity whilst leaving buildings intact<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> But that is crazy<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie: </font color= "#800080">Insane<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie: </font color= "#800080">(Tearfully) I don't want to die<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">I am afraid they are giving us no choice<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver:</font color= "#800080"> In the brochure..........<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Shut up about the damn brochure. We have just a few minutes left<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">What should we do then<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">It seems there is nothing we can do. The chef was right<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie: </font color= "#800080">The chef?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Yes, I think he saw this coming<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie:<font color="#FFFFFF"> Where is he now then? Somewhere safe?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">He's in the freezer.<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie:</font color= "#800080"> Can we all get in the freezer?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Only room for one<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">The pool is empty, there is no restaurant or electricity, no time for a massage, but there is still one thing we can use<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Minniver: </font color= "#800080">What is that?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080">The bar! It is well stocked and I suggest we all get very, very drunk<p>
<font color= "#800080">Miss Miniver:</font color= "#800080"> Just a small sherry for me<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Amandis, would you be good enough to open the bar and serve the drinks?<p>
<font color= "#800080"> Amandis: </font color= "#800080">Sure boss, come this way everyone<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie:</font color= "#800080"> I only have a debit card, no cash, sorry<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia: </font color= "#800080">Not a problem. All drinks are on the house<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis: <font color="#FFFFFF">What would you all like?<p>
<font color= "#800080">Barbie: </font color= "#800080">Champagne for me please<p>
<font color= "#800080">Jacquie:</font color= "#800080"> A very, very large scotch please. I am still having trouble taking this all in<p>
<font color= "#800080">Millie:</font color= "#800080"> I always wanted to try Guinness but never have. Perhaps now is the time<p>
<font color= "#800080">Amandis:</font color= "#800080"> What about you boss<p>
<font color= "#800080">Garcia:</font color= "#800080"> A very large glass of that very old Brandy<p>
